# Amnesia-Rebirth-Custom-Main-Menu-Script
A basic custom main menu script for Amnesia: Rebirth that allows you to show the main menu map. Removes the main menu music, some on screen effects and the intro sequence into a new game.

Place full folder path into your custom story folder, make sure the path is as follows script\custom\modules\MenuHandler.hps
If not already added to your resources then add the script folder to your resources.cfg and include sub directories.
